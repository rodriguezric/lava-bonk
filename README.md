# Lava Bonk

This is the origin story for lava emerging in the polygon universe 
of green squares. In a world where they once jumped freely, to live
for eternity came a threat that removed them from their world.

I made this game in under 30 minutes with my little framework. There's
still a lot to improve and honestly redo in the framework but it was
fun to build, nontheless.

## How to play
- Arrow keys to move and spacebar to jump. Left shift to shoot.
- Press enter on yellow squares for the compelling story.
- Press escape to pause the game if you're into that.
- Don't touch the red blocks, you'll die.
- Touch blue blocks to beat the level.
- Eventually you'll beat the game.
